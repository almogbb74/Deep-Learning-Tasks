    "## Homework #1: Prove the Gradients of the Sigmoid and Tanh Functions\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In this exercise, you are tasked with deriving the gradients of two common activation functions in deep learning: the sigmoid function and the tanh function. Prove each gradient and simplify your answers as much as possible.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. Sigmoid Function Gradient\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The sigmoid function is defined as:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Task\r\n",
    "1. Differentiate $\\sigma(x)$ with respect to $x$.\r\n",
    "2. Show that the derivative of $\\sigma(x)$ can be expressed in terms of $\\sigma(x)$ itself:\r\n",
    "   \r\n",
    "   $$\r\n",
    "   \\frac{d\\sigma(x)}{dx} = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x))\r\n",
    "   $$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Hint:** To simplify your work, start by applying the chain rule to the expression $\\sigma(x) = \\left(1 + e^{-x}\\right)^{-1}$.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. Tanh Function Gradient\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The hyperbolic tangent function is defined as:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\\tanh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}\r\n",

    "#### Task\r\n",
    "1. Differentiate $\\tanh(x)$ with respect to $x$.\r\n",
    "2. Show that the derivative of $\\tanh(x)$ can be expressed as:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   $$\r\n",
    "   \\frac{d\\tanh(x)}{dx} = 1 - \\tanh(x)^2\r\n",
    "   $$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Hint:** You may want to express $\\tanh(x)$ in terms of $\\sigma(x)$, noting that $\\tanh(x) = 2\\sigma(2x) - 1$, as an alternative approach.\r\n",

    "### Submission\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Write out the derivations step-by-step.\r\n",
    "2. Simplify each result as much as possible.\r\n",
    "3. Confirm that your results mat4. Complete the derivations in a Jupyter notebook. Use markdown cells continaing Latex code.\n",
    "5. Submit your notebook by uploading it to either Google Colab or GitHub.\n",
    "6. Share the link to your notebook with idan.tobis@gmail.com.ch the expected gradient forms given above.\r\n"
